1. Think of 3â€“5 personal details to collect from the user.(Done)
	a. first name.
	b. last name.
	c. age
	d. height(Meters)

2. Plan what type of variable each one will need.(Done)
	a. input-string
	b. input-string
	c. integer.
	d. float
	

3. Prompt the user for each piece of data and store the input using variables.

4. Use expressions (maybe a little math or string formatting) to do something simple with the data.
Example thoughts: Can I calculate how old someone will be in 5 years? Can I format a nice sentence from the inputs?

5. Run and test your script. Make sure it's clean and handles weird input decently.
